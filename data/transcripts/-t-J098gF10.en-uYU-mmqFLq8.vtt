going to work. I mean, 

01:10:19.983 --> 01:10:22.485
everyone's using this because 

01:10:20.617 --> 01:10:23.353
they have an assist. There's 

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:30.192
only **** reason why they use 

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:30.192

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:58.320

01:11:26.983 --> 01:11:30.052
roof right now. 

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:41.697
You fought hard out there. 

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:45.034
Return to base for debris. 

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:45.034
Requested fire mission. 

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.361

01:12:23.139 --> 01:12:26.208
works, bro. 

01:12:36.486 --> 01:12:40.723
Let's just let's just do this 

01:12:37.787 --> 01:12:43.726

Don't have it. God dang it. 90

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.751
Vertical recoil. 

01:14:50.586 --> 01:14:54.556
It's just a castle comp. 

01:14:55.591 --> 01:14:59.528
Nothing laser. 

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:04.233
Okay. 

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:10.773
Like why is my arm not working? 

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:10.773
What the **** 

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:22.918

01:17:02.518 --> 01:17:05.654
want to come to L, Sherim Pass. 

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:07.690
When it comes to this first 

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:09.825
pool of water, grab the first 

01:17:07.757 --> 01:17:10.392

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.161
streak. And what you guys 

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:14.297
want to do from here is you 

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:17.666
want to follow the river to the 

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:20.069
next pool of water. This will 

01:17:17.733 --> 01:17:22.738

loot cash, 3, 500 cash, a war 

01:17:22.804 --> 01:17:24.740
machine, and a kill streak. And 

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.707
then once you get out of this 

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:28.110
pool of water, you want to keep 

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:31.547
running in this direction. You 

01:17:28.176 --> 01:17:33.983
want to fly off this cliff. and 

01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:37.119

01:17:47.964 --> 01:17:50.999

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:57.633
Use this time to practice. We 

01:18:54.429 --> 01:18:57.633

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:36.104
Seems like a macro, bro. 

01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:42.144
I'm a macro. 

01:19:42.545 --> 01:19:47.216
Enemy soldier incoming. Nice. 

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:50.419
Enough training. Now, we face 

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:50.419

01:20:47.376 --> 01:20:50.278
AO. 

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:53.215
Enemy base holding high-value 

01:20:52.014 --> 01:20:56.318
equipment have been located. 

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:56.318
Secure on

01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:36.591
This is strong. I could stay 

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:36.591

Little easy work for the funny. 

01:41:31.586 --> 01:41:37.791
gang. I got no selfies for the 

01:41:33.921 --> 01:41:37.791

01:41:39.127 --> 01:41:45.332
I would like. I do like 

01:41:42.262 --> 01:41:45.332
spraying this. 

01:41:53.541 --> 01:41:56.710
Do it again now. 

01:41:57.612 --> 01:42:00.581
Wow. 

01:42:23.004 --> 01:42:29.710
I'm driving. I'll use that to 

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:29.710
my advantage. 

01:42:57.238 --> 01:43:00.374
The disease iron. 

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:49.323
Oh, man. This site sucks, bro. 

01:43:51.659 --> 01:43:54.629
They're like a two and a half 

01:43:53.428 --> 01:43:57.732
optic. Is there a two and a 

01:43:54.695 --> 01:44:00.801
half optic that doesn't **** Or 

01:43:57.799 --> 01:44:00.801
look. 

01:44:10.545 --> 01:44:17.885
I wanted like a three-yard X. 

01:44:15.750 --> 01:44:20.454
whatever this one is, three 

01:44:17.952 --> 01:44:24.125
point four. Yeah, it's inbound. 

01:44:20.521 --> 01:44:27.094
Marking new safe zone. Get two 

01:44:24.192 --> 01:44:32.599
point seven. Maybe, maybe a 

01:44:27.161 --> 01:44:32.599
three solid Four is too much. 

01:44:51.085 --> 01:44:55.589
Enemy squad is tracking your 

01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:58.926
position. Alright. Load and 

01:44:55.656 --> 01:44:58.926
drop headed your way. 

01:45:02.163 --> 01:45:07.935
Really? All the load ups on the 

01:45:04.632 --> 01:45:07.935
other side of the water. 

01:45:12.507 --> 01:45:16.443
Moving here. 

01:45:51.812 --> 01:45:56.049
Enemy UAV active. 

01:48:00.207 --> 01:48:05.379
Gas is closing in. Relocating 

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:05.379
the safe zone. 

01:48:13.821 --> 01:48:16.923
Moving here. 

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:56.596
**** 

01:49:04.972 --> 01:49:08.275
What? How did he? Did the car 

01:49:07.073 --> 01:49:11.378
take him with them? Like, what 

01:49:08.342 --> 01:49:11.378

01:49:48.015 --> 01:49:53.120
You like it? You like you have 

01:49:49.215 --> 01:49:53.120
to reload, you idiot. 

01:51:01.522 --> 01:51:04.658
Excuse me? 

01:51:05.459 --> 01:51:08.428
There is no way you're telling 

01:51:07.127 --> 01:51:10.430
me my bullets just stop 

01:51:08.495 --> 01:51:13.967
registering right there. That's 

01:51:10.497 --> 01:51:17.003
crazy. Who would have thought? 

01:51:14.034 --> 01:51:17.003
Bro. 

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:41.528
Moving here. 

01:51:58.112 --> 01:52:01.181
Moving here. 

01:52:10.624 --> 01:52:15.229
Moving here. 

01:52:15.029 --> 01:52:15.229
there's 

01:52:15.963 --> 01:52:19.332
a person in there. 

01:52:29.543 --> 01:52:33.880
You've got gas inbound. Marking 

01:52:30.878 --> 01:52:33.880
grenade 

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:46.393
**** 

01:53:44.151 --> 01:53:47.253
Moving here. 

01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:55.662
Oh, we'll get stuck on him. 

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:57.030
He's getting stuck on 

01:53:55.728 --> 01:53:59.799
everything. Why don't you? Save 

01:53:57.097 --> 01:53:59.799
zone 

01:54:03.537 --> 01:54:06.573
For **** sakes, bro. Look, why 

01:54:05.405 --> 01:54:10.777

01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:10.777

01:54:26.727 --> 01:54:30.663
Oh my god, dude. Okay. So, that 

01:54:28.562 --> 01:54:32.099
optic sucked in there. I want a 

01:54:30.730 --> 01:54:35.635
better optic, bro. This optic 

01:54:32.166 --> 01:54:42.042

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:42.042
tell me the range, bro. Mm. 

01:54:48.048 --> 01:54:51.384
Hop in there real quick. 

01:59:58.158 --> 02:00:03.463
What the heck? ah 

02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:07.767
check your gear and weapons. We 

02:00:04.898 --> 02:00:07.767
go 

02:00:15.675 --> 02:00:18.778
What the **** 

02:00:31.958 --> 02:00:36.662
Tell me why ain't nothing but 

02:01:04.057 --> 02:01:09.195
I dabbed. Oh, maybe not. 

02:04:14.247 --> 02:04:17.249
Alright. 

02:04:19.185 --> 02:04:22.321
They won Holland. 

02:05:18.178 --> 02:05:23.182
Use this time to practice. We 

02:05:19.979 --> 02:05:23.182
will be deploying soon 

02:05:32.525 --> 02:05:38.764
Hostile dropping into the area. 

02:05:34.693 --> 02:05:38.764
Watch the skies. 

02:05:57.150 --> 02:06:02.755
Warm up is over. Stand by for 

02:05:58.585 --> 02:06:02.755
deployment to the war zone. 

02:06:37.624 --> 02:06:41.861
Avoid the gap. Get to the safe 

02:06:38.924 --> 02:06:41.861
zone 

02:07:22.602 --> 02:07:26.038
Eliminate all targets in the A 

02:07:39.419 --> 02:07:42.655
high-value equipment in enemy 

02:07:40.787 --> 02:07:45.891
containers. Move in and secure 

02:07:42.722 --> 02:07:45.891
that equipment. 

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:11.517
Pro, dude. This game is so 

02:08:05.377 --> 02:08:11.517
tough. Yeah, this is. 

02:08:13.019 --> 02:08:16.355
Looks like we got another one. 

02:08:16.656 --> 02:08:21.894
On the ground. Fight for your 

02:08:18.690 --> 02:08:21.894
chance to redeploy 

02:08:24.097 --> 02:08:28.067
So does home. 

02:08:29.068 --> 02:08:33.305
boy. Soldiers 

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:38.344
last two standing were leader 

02:08:54.127 --> 02:08:57.263
will rise soon. 

02:08:58.464 --> 02:09:03.269
Just wasted all my time. 

02:09:13.413 --> 02:09:17.049
Advise for redeployment. 

02:09:24.624 --> 02:09:27.626
Hey. 

02:09:59.525 --> 02:10:02.594
Dude, what? 

02:10:06.299 --> 02:10:09.735
Positive ID on multiple 

02:10:08.368 --> 02:10:12.838
Locations are marked on your 

02:10:09.802 --> 02:10:12.838
attack map. 

02:10:13.072 --> 02:10:17.042
Enemy, UAV, overhead. 

02:10:38.664 --> 02:10:41.800
Be advised. 

02:11:28.514 --> 02:11:35.121
Enemy dropping into the AO. He 

02:11:32.585 --> 02:11:36.555
was like, what the **** Learn 

02:11:35.188 --> 02:11:39.725
from the lost. Failure is a 

02:11:36.622 --> 02:11:39.725
wise teacher. 

02:11:43.062 --> 02:11:45.764
Oh my god, dude. I just want to 

02:11:44.530 --> 02:11:49.268
play with it. I can't do solos, 

02:11:45.831 --> 02:11:49.268
man. I'm losing my mind 

02:12:37.049 --> 02:12:42.588
do not want to play dude but 

02:12:39.718 --> 02:12:42.588
like 

02:13:00.039 --> 02:13:03.275
Two **** hours, bro. 

02:16:22.675 --> 02:16:29.414
Don't say noone on. I'm 

02:16:26.112 --> 02:16:29.414
learning the one plane. 

02:16:45.398 --> 02:16:49.134
There's noone on, man. 

02:17:00.546 --> 02:17:04.249
and thirteen. What did you say? 

02:17:03.215 --> 02:17:05.718
You have to be a certain right 

02:17:04.316 --> 02:17:07.019
to use Bitten thirteen. You 

02:17:05.784 --> 02:17:09.421
actually have to get it through 

02:17:07.086 --> 02:17:12.458
DMZ but I can I can get it for 

02:17:09.488 --> 02:17:15.660
you in a cheap. But everyone 

02:17:12.525 --> 02:17:15.660
says that it's 

02:17:47.726 --> 02:17:51.830
Oh, nice play, dude. It was 

02:17:50.262 --> 02:17:54.233
incredibly decentky. He sorted 

02:17:51.897 --> 02:17:56.635
it wrong here. Okay, he got 

02:17:54.300 --> 02:17:58.337
this thing. Uh. Yeah, good 

02:17:56.702 --> 02:18:00.172
player. Very, very desyncy for 

02:17:58.404 --> 02:18:03.575
some reason in solos. I don't 

02:18:00.239 --> 02:18:03.575
know how much knee he has. 

02:18:03.742 --> 02:18:08.680
It looked like he prefired the 

02:18:27.166 --> 02:18:30.502
No one on, man. 

02:19:18.851 --> 02:19:24.189
No **** on, bro. At home, I 

02:19:20.419 --> 02:19:24.189
still listen to murdered. 

02:19:39.838 --> 02:19:42.908
Oh, boy. 

02:22:08.053 --> 02:22:11.122
Just one glass 

02:23:01.740 --> 02:23:06.377
Check your gear and weapons. We 

02:23:03.508 --> 02:23:06.377
go soon 

02:23:52.591 --> 02:23:57.896
Preparation is done. Now, you 

02:23:54.593 --> 02:23:57.896
deploy to the war zone. 

02:24:22.421 --> 02:24:25.723
dumping fire. Get ready. 

02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:35.634
Jazz is closing on your 

02:24:35.167 --> 02:24:38.503
position. Suggest you get 

02:24:35.701 --> 02:24:38.503
moving 

02:25:04.596 --> 02:25:07.899
Primary objective is to 

02:25:05.129 --> 02:25:07.899
eliminate all 

02:25:31.223 --> 02:25:34.492
That could've been bad. 

02:25:36.061 --> 02:25:44.302
Will they patch this? it. This 

02:25:39.731 --> 02:25:44.302
one. I patched it. 

02:25:44.937 --> 02:25:50.041
Oh my god, they patched it. 

02:25:51.009 --> 02:25:54.012
Heal. 

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:16.948
Look, **** we got another one. 

02:29:15.680 --> 02:29:21.185
This is a gulag. You'll have to 

02:29:17.015 --> 02:29:21.185
fight to earn redeployment. 

02:29:33.565 --> 02:29:39.604
Dead soldiers, I offer you a 

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:43.674
life for a life youth and I 

02:29:39.671 --> 02:29:43.674
will return you to your will 

02:30:18.710 --> 02:30:21.613
My team is **** dumbest. Oh my 

02:30:20.345 --> 02:30:22.614

swear to god, I'm going to get 

02:30:22.680 --> 02:30:25.650
off. 

02:32:18.730 --> 02:32:24.469
so locked in on my homework I 

02:32:21.766 --> 02:32:26.337
feel bad. Now, I'll make it up 

02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:32.277
and we'll play like like three 

02:32:26.404 --> 02:32:34.912
hours That sounds like fun. I'm 

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:37.015
really losing it but are you 

02:32:34.979 --> 02:32:38.816

02:32:40.652 --> 02:32:47.592
already. I'm so fine. I'm 

02:32:43.588 --> 02:32:49.127
really annoyed. Those are mean 

02:32:47.659 --> 02:32:52.030

02:32:49.194 --> 02:32:54.665

02:32:52.097 --> 02:32:56.501

02:33:05.343 --> 02:33:08.346
Uh I'm going to play. We 

02:33:07.212 --> 02:33:13.151
want to play duos. Trios or 

02:33:08.412 --> 02:33:16.487
quets. Not up to you. Whatever 

02:33:13.218 --> 02:33:16.487
you're in the mood for. 

02:33:16.654 --> 02:33:19.891
I mean, is he, he can handle he 

02:33:19.224 --> 02:33:22.059
can handle quads or what? We're 

02:33:19.958 --> 02:33:24.696
just running together. Do you 

02:33:22.126 --> 02:33:27.798
know who I am? You referred 

02:33:24.763 --> 02:33:27.798
will 

02:33:28.066 --> 02:33:34.205
Virtual. Are you serious right 

02:33:31.802 --> 02:33:35.473
now? You better turn the **** 

02:33:34.272 --> 02:33:36.974
up then. Are you playing on 

02:33:35.540 --> 02:33:38.843
controller or let me get? Oh, 

02:33:37.041 --> 02:33:40.678
hell no, bro. I was going to 

02:33:38.910 --> 02:33:42.313
play on controller but like, I 

02:33:40.745 --> 02:33:42.914
just don't have a scuff and I 

02:33:42.380 --> 02:33:44.716
just don't want to buy money 

02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:47.519
for a scuff so. Well, I bought 

02:33:44.782 --> 02:33:51.656
a $500 aim controller and it 

02:33:47.585 --> 02:33:52.957
broke. What? It broke? Yeah. 

02:33:51.723 --> 02:33:54.058
How the **** did you, how did 

02:33:53.057 --> 02:33:56.360
**** you break on? You **** sit 

02:33:54.125 --> 02:33:58.529
on that? No, bro. It, so I was 

02:33:56.427 --> 02:33:59.964
playing, so I, I have a, those 

02:33:58.596 --> 02:34:04.002
control freak things on. Oh, 

02:34:00.031 --> 02:34:05.269
yeah, yeah, yeah. and I guess 

02:34:04.068 --> 02:34:06.770
when I push forward, there's 

02:34:05.336 --> 02:34:09.139
enough pressure where it broke. 

02:34:06.837 --> 02:34:11.609
No. Where the. From the analog 

02:34:09.206 --> 02:34:13.144
stick? Like, not the whole 

02:34:11.676 --> 02:34:15.680
stick, just like the piece 

02:34:13.211 --> 02:34:17.148
where is it? The removable, 

02:34:15.747 --> 02:34:17.815
right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 

02:34:17.215 --> 02:34:20.151
Uh huh. So, like, you know 

02:34:17.881 --> 02:34:21.619
where you untake it out? That 

02:34:20.218 --> 02:34:24.288
little like hexagon piece, like 

02:34:21.686 --> 02:34:26.124
one of the sides broke. What 

02:34:24.355 --> 02:34:27.992
the **** Yeah, I don't know. 

02:34:26.190 --> 02:34:29.127
And they won't like replace it 

02:34:28.058 --> 02:34:29.761
for you. I'm just going to work 

02:34:29.194 --> 02:34:31.629
here. Yeah, no, I got, I got 

02:34:29.828 --> 02:34:33.164
unlimited warrant. I got, I 

02:34:31.696 --> 02:34:37.201
just send it there and they'll 

02:34:33.231 --> 02:34:38.536
fix it but **** That **** 

02:34:37.268 --> 02:34:41.206
sucks. What the **** I mean, I 

02:34:38.602 --> 02:34:41.706
was going to then I had 

02:34:41.272 --> 02:34:43.908
another. Go crazy on 

02:34:41.773 --> 02:34:45.543
controller. Oh, James. This is 

02:34:43.975 --> 02:34:47.412
insane, dude. I know the, the 

02:34:45.609 --> 02:34:50.682
game is 10 times harder without 

02:34:47.479 --> 02:34:51.949
like the back, back pedals. Or 

02:34:50.748 --> 02:34:53.551
what? And you can't jump. Cuz 

02:34:52.016 --> 02:34:54.686
then you can't jump, right? 

02:34:53.618 --> 02:34:58.790
Like I'm playing club but it's 

02:34:54.752 --> 02:35:00.358
even harder to jump. Jumping's 

02:34:58.856 --> 02:35:03.260
literally all just **** warzone 

02:35:00.424 --> 02:35:03.260
is so. 

02:35:03.761 --> 02:35:07.131
Warzone. Now, Warzone two is 

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:08.633
only worth jumping. Get nothing 

02:35:07.198 --> 02:35:10.568
out of it. Yeah, it's true. 

02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:11.436
Yeah, luckily, I've been just 

02:35:10.668 --> 02:35:12.637
**** I've been just grinding 

02:35:11.502 --> 02:35:15.106
all these **** guns I want. 

02:35:12.704 --> 02:35:16.741
Like, this raw I have is **** 

02:35:15.173 --> 02:35:18.676
disgusting, dude. It's so dumb. 

02:35:16.808 --> 02:35:21.646
I'm on the right optic on it, 

02:35:18.743 --> 02:35:21.813
bro. 

02:35:21.713 --> 02:35:21.813
I 

02:35:21.879 --> 02:35:28.219
took the MOP bro. I don't use 

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:29.821
but Yeah, the MOP. I **** with 

02:35:28.286 --> 02:35:31.622
the MOP. Yeah, but you can't 

02:35:29.887 --> 02:35:32.590
see anything in a distance, 

02:35:31.689 --> 02:35:33.825
bro. Right when you start 

02:35:32.657 --> 02:35:36.093
shooting, you lose someone's 

02:35:33.892 --> 02:35:37.829
crushing. You do, no? What else 

02:35:36.160 --> 02:35:38.763
is a good slagger, right? The 

02:35:37.896 --> 02:35:40.364
slagger is good, right? But I 

02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:41.466
have one right now. Trying it. 

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:44.302
I tried the other one. The 

02:35:41.533 --> 02:35:46.170
three point seven. Too much 

02:35:44.368 --> 02:35:47.939
visual recoil. I don't know. I 

02:35:46.237 --> 02:35:48.639
saw something online where it 

02:35:48.005 --> 02:35:49.373
said like close. It's supposed 

02:35:48.706 --> 02:35:51.809
to be better than far, right? 

02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:53.144
Or some **** like that? I don't 

02:35:51.876 --> 02:35:53.778
know. I saw some **** article 

02:35:53.211 --> 02:35:57.815
on it. Just zooms in. There's 

02:35:53.845 --> 02:36:00.485
more zoo Oh, god. We got two 

02:35:57.915 --> 02:36:05.523
**** idiots with us. Alright, 

02:36:00.552 --> 02:36:07.725
we'll just, and like we know 

02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:08.926
So, what you've been doing? 

02:36:07.792 --> 02:36:11.896
Just warzone? Called you? 

02:36:08.993 --> 02:36:13.631
Warzone. Warzone. Warzone. Call 

02:36:11.963 --> 02:36:17.201
of Duty. More warzone? Yeah. 

02:36:13.698 --> 02:36:18.102
All you could play on Facebook. 

02:36:17.268 --> 02:36:22.106
Really? They're like the only 

02:36:18.169 --> 02:36:24.041
popular game on Facebook? Yeah. 

02:36:22.173 --> 02:36:27.845
Oh, there's not really much 

02:36:24.108 --> 02:36:29.080
else. So, Doc's here. This 

02:36:27.912 --> 02:36:30.414
game's not too hot. This game 

02:36:29.147 --> 02:36:32.950
is actually pretty fun though. 

02:36:30.481 --> 02:36:35.052
Okay, dude. Listen. Did you 

02:36:33.017 --> 02:36:37.154
play warzone at all? No, no. I 

02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:38.556
I didn't play the end towards 

02:36:37.221 --> 02:36:42.126
warzone. I only played I just 

02:36:38.623 --> 02:36:43.527
enjoyed this too. Like there's 

02:36:42.193 --> 02:36:44.194
so many things you can do in 

02:36:43.594 --> 02:36:45.363
Warzone. One that you can't do 

02:36:44.261 --> 02:36:47.699
unless you like like you know 

02:36:45.429 --> 02:36:48.899
when you play in this game. Uh 

02:36:47.765 --> 02:36:50.100
yeah yeah they usually have 

02:36:48.966 --> 02:36:52.603
momentum right? Yeah there's 

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:53.137
**** nothing. And then when you 

02:36:52.670 --> 02:36:55.907
jump you lose all your 

02:36:53.203 --> 02:36:58.209
momentum. Like what is this? I 

02:36:55.974 --> 02:36:59.043
tried to jump across a roof and 

02:36:58.276 --> 02:36:59.844
I lose all my movement. I'm 

02:36:59.109 --> 02:37:02.246
going to pull my parachute. 

02:36:59.911 --> 02:37:03.881
Yeah like I don't I don't like 

02:37:02.313 --> 02:37:05.449
hate that there's not like **** 

02:37:03.948 --> 02:37:08.853
nerd movement gamers now right? 

02:37:05.516 --> 02:37:10.521
Like but just **** I think the 

02:37:08.920 --> 02:37:14.359
slide is useless. The slide is 

02:37:10.588 --> 02:37:15.959
useless. Kinda **** Well, the 

02:37:14.425 --> 02:37:16.961
dolphin dive is good. So, if 

02:37:16.026 --> 02:37:18.462
you're on the lower. Terrible. 

02:37:17.028 --> 02:37:20.031
If you're on a lower ledge, you 

02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:22.099
could dolphin dive off and pull 

02:37:20.097 --> 02:37:24.502
your chute instantly and you 

02:37:22.166 --> 02:37:30.508
you go across the ledges really 

02:37:24.569 --> 02:37:31.909
fast. Um Like like clefts and 

02:37:30.608 --> 02:37:35.479
**** You can you can pull your 

02:37:32.009 --> 02:37:36.580
**** better. I don't know. 

02:37:35.546 --> 02:37:37.915
That's the only good thing I 

02:37:36.647 --> 02:37:39.250
found about dolphin diving. 

02:37:37.982 --> 02:37:40.885
Maybe dolphin diving a cover 

02:37:39.317 --> 02:37:41.686
maybe. But. Yeah it's good for 

02:37:40.951 --> 02:37:42.920
like if I'm trying to like 

02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:43.721
rotate through somewhere and 

02:37:42.987 --> 02:37:46.090
there's just a **** sniper 

02:37:43.787 --> 02:37:49.393
sitting somewhere. Gonna just 

02:37:46.157 --> 02:37:49.393
fall and dive everywhere. 

02:37:58.036 --> 02:38:02.072
You ping this? 

02:38:14.652 --> 02:38:19.924
For your squad, soldier. 

02:38:18.589 --> 02:38:24.261
Alright. Let's go where they 

02:38:19.991 --> 02:38:27.297
go, I guess. closing in. That's 

02:38:24.328 --> 02:38:27.297
shot. 

02:38:32.570 --> 02:38:36.473
Watch the sky. 

02:38:39.544 --> 02:38:44.581
I just look straight down at 

02:38:41.545 --> 02:38:44.581
the floor. 

02:38:50.488 --> 02:38:53.925
There's a lot of people. **** 

02:38:53.291 --> 02:38:54.992
Don't, I will go live. We'll go 

02:38:53.991 --> 02:38:59.029
live to the left. Yeah, I'm 

02:38:55.059 --> 02:38:59.029
going to say. 

02:39:00.098 --> 02:39:08.505
clear to engage all targets. 

02:39:02.966 --> 02:39:08.505
The **** LGs. Okay. 

02:39:12.110 --> 02:39:15.480
I don't know. I feel like this 

02:39:14.512 --> 02:39:16.280
**** three-play **** where you 

02:39:15.546 --> 02:39:18.082
have to really grab one. I 

02:39:16.347 --> 02:39:20.151
don't know. You get **** 

02:39:18.149 --> 02:39:22.953
shredded if you don't have one. 

02:39:20.218 --> 02:39:23.954
Well, the TTK and regular, 

02:39:23.020 --> 02:39:26.424
regular warzone was a while. 

02:39:24.021 --> 02:39:28.125
Lots slower. If they survive, 

02:39:26.490 --> 02:39:28.759
they reject. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, 

02:39:28.192 --> 02:39:31.862
there's a three plane in here 

02:39:28.826 --> 02:39:31.862
if you want it. 

02:39:36.567 --> 02:39:40.771
He might butt. 

02:39:42.707 --> 02:39:46.644
entered the gulag. Surviving 

02:39:45.042 --> 02:39:50.581
earns and redeployment. Square 

02:39:46.711 --> 02:39:55.853
meters enter the gulag. I died 

02:39:50.648 --> 02:39:55.853
the but we moved it into the 

02:40:06.030 --> 02:40:08.432
Finally, quads, bro. I can 

02:40:07.131 --> 02:40:09.967
actually read what they do. 

02:40:08.499 --> 02:40:11.635
Holy **** So, they just sit 

02:40:10.034 --> 02:40:12.570
corners and they remove. Yo, 

02:40:11.702 --> 02:40:15.739
squadmate was broken. Oh, solos 

02:40:12.637 --> 02:40:15.739
is actually. 

02:40:19.343 --> 02:40:23.480
I never like playing Battle 

02:40:20.344 --> 02:40:23.480
Royale so 

02:40:23.647 --> 02:40:26.316
redeployment. I'm going to try 

02:40:25.716 --> 02:40:27.718
solo duos. It was even more 

02:40:26.383 --> 02:40:30.688
terrible. There's just two of 

02:40:27.785 --> 02:40:33.624
them in the window. **** did it 

02:40:30.754 --> 02:40:35.392
one? There's two. I want to 

02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:37.494
play trios but then everyone's 

02:40:35.459 --> 02:40:40.131
like a six man so like no. I 

02:40:37.561 --> 02:40:42.166
want to do that. Yeah, I know. 

02:40:40.197 --> 02:40:45.602
Yeah. Once a normal **** trio's 

02:40:42.233 --> 02:40:47.404
coming out, bro. for the people 

02:40:45.669 --> 02:40:49.073
that couldn't find a fourth. 

02:40:47.471 --> 02:40:49.807
Yeah, I know. Usually, I just 

02:40:49.140 --> 02:40:51.142
play with like, I have like 

02:40:49.874 --> 02:40:55.913
three friends that like to play 

02:40:51.209 --> 02:40:57.014
so. My friends get like **** 

02:40:55.980 --> 02:40:59.383
terrible frames in this game. 

02:40:57.081 --> 02:41:00.852
They have like a 2062 so I was 

02:40:59.450 --> 02:41:01.419
like just surprised. It's so 

02:41:00.918 --> 02:41:03.587
bad. They're like running 

02:41:01.486 --> 02:41:08.058
twenty-four or like **** forty 

02:41:03.654 --> 02:41:08.058
frames. What? 

02:41:10.928 --> 02:41:16.066
Dude, I have a twelve nine 

02:41:13.764 --> 02:41:17.535
hundred K with the 3080 TI and 

02:41:16.133 --> 02:41:19.269
I still get horrible frames. 

02:41:17.602 --> 02:41:21.472
Yeah, I have a thirty. And I'm 

02:41:19.336 --> 02:41:23.340
on right now. And I'm on a dual 

02:41:21.539 --> 02:41:24.141
PC setup. Oh, you're dual 

02:41:23.407 --> 02:41:25.409
streaming too? Yeah, I was 

02:41:24.208 --> 02:41:26.977
about to say if you're not, 

02:41:25.476 --> 02:41:29.480
then, this probably even worse, 

02:41:27.044 --> 02:41:31.315
right? Bro. I don't even think 

02:41:29.547 --> 02:41:34.384
it's possible to play this game 

02:41:31.382 --> 02:41:34.384
ever streaming. 

02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:38.288
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. 

02:41:37.788 --> 02:41:41.625
Wait. Wait. Wait. Have you 

02:41:38.355 --> 02:41:44.595
noticed the mouse symbol like? 

02:41:41.692 --> 02:41:46.730
No, not really. That was a lot. 

02:41:44.662 --> 02:41:48.165
I mean, like, I don't know. My 

02:41:46.797 --> 02:41:51.435
my sense in this game never 

02:41:48.232 --> 02:41:54.405
feels like right. It always 

02:41:51.502 --> 02:41:55.206
kind of changes. Always feels 

02:41:54.472 --> 02:42:00.845
like **** There you go, the 

02:41:55.273 --> 02:42:04.114
strong Where is it? Let's go 

02:42:00.912 --> 02:42:04.114
Hook me up with cash. 

02:42:04.348 --> 02:42:10.520
Yeah, I know. I've I've played 

02:42:06.617 --> 02:42:10.520
I played the **** 

02:42:11.222 --> 02:42:15.592
Floyd back. Hook me up with 

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:15.592
cash. 

02:42:16.494 --> 02:42:21.432
You know, I'll drop it to him. 

02:42:17.728 --> 02:42:23.767
Here we go. Got cash here. I 

02:42:21.498 --> 02:42:24.635
got played I think the 

02:42:23.834 --> 02:42:26.103
beginning of the multiplayer 

02:42:24.702 --> 02:42:27.404
like in the. Moving. And not 

02:42:26.169 --> 02:42:28.772
like beta but I think like the 

02:42:27.471 --> 02:42:29.573
early access stage and that's 

02:42:28.839 --> 02:42:31.075
the game I I literally cannot 

02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.443
play this game. This game is 

02:42:31.175 --> 02:42:36.180
**** terrible. It was really 

02:42:32.543 --> 02:42:36.780
**** bad. What the. Like just 

02:42:36.247 --> 02:42:37.414
the beginning. Like I think 

02:42:36.847 --> 02:42:39.182
before they nerfed all these 

02:42:37.515 --> 02:42:41.652
**** guns. I like I I I was not 

02:42:39.249 --> 02:42:44.955
having fun at all over here. 

02:42:41.719 --> 02:42:44.955
Not even cool of it. 

02:42:57.635 --> 02:43:07.244
From disposal. A charge over 

02:43:02.540 --> 02:43:07.244
there. What the **** 

02:43:11.082 --> 02:43:15.052
I mean it's **** other 

02:43:26.564 --> 02:43:32.670
Getting **** Bro, how many 

02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:34.338
kills do I have to? Alright, 

02:43:32.736 --> 02:43:37.475
wait, hold on. Let me, let me, 

02:43:34.404 --> 02:43:39.276
let me take all my Oh my god. 

02:43:37.575 --> 02:43:41.979
**** grenade, dude. Are you 

02:43:39.343 --> 02:43:44.848
trolling? I just chucked that 

02:43:42.079 --> 02:43:46.984
**** back. No, no, no, no, no, 

02:43:44.915 --> 02:43:48.452
this is actually ridiculous. 

02:43:47.051 --> 02:43:50.520
I'm going in. I'm going. Oh my 

02:43:48.519 --> 02:43:52.856
god. Fire. They **** beamed 

02:43:50.587 --> 02:43:53.924
too. No, no, no, no, no. I 

02:43:52.923 --> 02:43:56.293
don't want to, I don't want to 

02:43:53.991 --> 02:43:57.394
play this game. Hurry in, bro. 

02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:59.162
I'm just coming to you. Yeah, 

02:43:57.461 --> 02:44:04.301
I'm just diffusing this **** 

02:43:59.229 --> 02:44:04.301
bro. Jesus Christ, man. 

02:44:06.003 --> 02:44:13.210
There's a team here, I guess. 

02:44:10.508 --> 02:44:15.679
What is there? I know. Ammo 

02:44:13.277 --> 02:44:17.614
here. Black Move to that 

02:44:15.746 --> 02:44:20.884
location. More intent to 

02:44:17.681 --> 02:44:20.884
follow. UAV active 

02:44:22.019 --> 02:44:26.189
I think they have a load out. 

02:44:40.037 --> 02:44:43.073
What the **** happened to you? 

02:44:41.639 --> 02:44:44.675
I I don't know. I shot a one 

02:44:43.140 --> 02:44:47.844
through the window and 

02:44:44.742 --> 02:44:47.844
instantly died. 

02:44:55.086 --> 02:44:58.055
Drop them. 

02:45:24.582 --> 02:45:27.251
I'm just going to line back 

02:45:25.783 --> 02:45:28.251
down and just **** pray bro. 

02:45:27.318 --> 02:45:28.919
Just go with your load. You're 

02:45:28.318 --> 02:45:30.187
probably going to win the 

02:45:28.986 --> 02:45:32.623
building. I mean, he's probably 

02:45:30.254 --> 02:45:34.224
in the building. Yeah I don't 

02:45:32.690 --> 02:45:36.460
know bro but I'm **** going in 

02:45:34.291 --> 02:45:39.696
this **** I don't care. That's 

02:45:36.527 --> 02:45:39.696
you **** **** bro. 

02:45:39.964 --> 02:45:43.867
Give me the **** out. **** 

02:45:42.399 --> 02:45:45.469
leave this game now. **** idiot 

02:45:43.934 --> 02:45:49.473
is sitting in the **** right 

02:45:45.536 --> 02:45:51.041
corner with them. **** fenick. 

02:45:49.540 --> 02:45:52.509
Their death is so dumb. Oh my 

02:45:51.108 --> 02:45:53.844
god, they have my Ryan. They 

02:45:52.576 --> 02:45:57.014
have Orion on all their guns. 

02:45:53.911 --> 02:45:58.014
Your squad is KIA. It is up to 

02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:00.818
you. Dude, are you **** 

02:45:58.081 --> 02:46:03.387
serious? What? Why am I 

02:46:00.885 --> 02:46:05.389
playing? What? What? You like 

02:46:03.454 --> 02:46:08.526
my ice cream, ma'am? Fun as 

02:46:05.456 --> 02:46:11.828
hell. Oh, yeah. This is a lot 

02:46:08.592 --> 02:46:11.828
of fun. Mm hmm. 

02:46:12.930 --> 02:46:14.164
I I literally like peeked out 

02:46:13.564 --> 02:46:15.899
the window and I think all four 

02:46:14.231 --> 02:46:19.103
of them shot at me. More than 

02:46:15.966 --> 02:46:20.470
my SPMM where it's terrible. 

02:46:19.170 --> 02:46:21.705
I'm too used to playing with my 

02:46:20.537 --> 02:46:24.041
brother. I gotta **** like lock 

02:46:21.772 --> 02:46:25.609
in or some **** You gotta 

02:46:24.108 --> 02:46:26.710
realize that they shoot faster 

02:46:25.676 --> 02:46:29.146
than you can shoot. They're 

02:46:26.777 --> 02:46:31.215
don't no matter. They got 16 

02:46:29.213 --> 02:46:35.051
scoops of G film. And they got 

02:46:31.281 --> 02:46:35.051
a controller too. 

02:46:39.757 --> 02:46:40.991
so they don't miss and if they 

02:46:40.457 --> 02:46:44.194
do miss, it's because they 

02:46:41.058 --> 02:46:47.430
didn't get aim assist and oh, 

02:46:44.261 --> 02:46:47.430
what a great game. 

02:46:47.865 --> 02:46:53.703
Jesus bro. It was fun. 

02:47:03.314 --> 02:47:06.550
among steroids, monitoring 

02:47:03.881 --> 02:47:06.550
meds, I train 

02:48:13.484 --> 02:48:16.453
or kiss 

02:48:25.229 --> 02:48:31.468
Up, Kanye Garband again. Bye 

02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:33.070

02:48:31.535 --> 02:48:34.638
mean, I like, I love Kanye and 

02:48:33.137 --> 02:48:37.073
I **** love all his music but 

02:48:34.705 --> 02:48:41.678
like, Jesus Christ. They're so 

02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:42.980
stupid. I love Hitler. Like I 

02:48:41.745 --> 02:48:44.648
didn't wake up until like 2 PM 

02:48:43.046 --> 02:48:45.582
this morning. So I like looked 

02:48:44.715 --> 02:48:47.084
at my phone and the first thing 

02:48:45.649 --> 02:48:48.886
I see is **** Kanye West 

02:48:47.151 --> 02:48:52.022
running. I was like oh God. Not 

02:48:48.952 --> 02:48:52.022

02:49:21.685 --> 02:49:27.257
Warm up while you can. We will 

02:49:24.187 --> 02:49:27.257
deploy soon. 

02:50:01.792 --> 02:50:07.164
Okay. He dropped the, do we 

02:50:06.630 --> 02:50:14.604
drop the news yet? I don't 

02:50:07.231 --> 02:50:15.672
know. No I keep crashing. 

02:50:14.671 --> 02:50:17.073
Crashing, bro. We did it like, 

02:50:15.739 --> 02:50:19.776
we did like four days in a row. 

02:50:17.140 --> 02:50:23.480
Four different days. We had 

02:50:19.843 --> 02:50:25.149
like 13 wins. Oh. No. **** 

02:50:23.547 --> 02:50:26.683
Fifth, fifth, 15, what was it? 

02:50:25.215 --> 02:50:29.186
It was 13 wins every every day. 

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:30.454
We go for 4 days. We dev aired 

02:50:29.253 --> 02:50:33.223
every fifth game and every time 

02:50:30.521 --> 02:50:36.526
we got in a new contract. No. 

02:50:33.289 --> 02:50:41.965
Jeez. I was just stopped 

02:50:36.593 --> 02:50:41.965
drawing. That's so dumb, bro. 

02:50:43.066 --> 02:50:48.004
Whoever called me out of the 

02:50:44.668 --> 02:50:50.240
pregame, come get the smoke. I 

02:50:48.071 --> 02:50:54.611
love what Brock has reminds me 

02:50:50.307 --> 02:50:54.611

02:50:58.549 --> 02:51:01.017
go-to spot to get on this **** 

02:50:59.616 --> 02:51:02.686
map. It's like everywhere 

02:51:01.084 --> 02:51:03.987
that's like inoculated. Never 

02:51:02.786 --> 02:51:07.056

02:51:04.053 --> 02:51:07.056
Christ 

02:51:08.225 --> 02:51:11.461
Let's take the job. 

02:51:14.097 --> 02:51:19.269
I feel like our teammates 

02:51:15.965 --> 02:51:19.269
kind of know what they're doing 

02:51:19.536 --> 02:51:22.238
Seems like a driver. Oh, 

02:51:21.604 --> 02:51:25.875
there's two people on him. I'm 

02:51:22.305 --> 02:51:28.879
not landing on them. Get to 

02:51:25.942 --> 02:51:29.112
work. 

02:51:28.946 --> 02:51:29.112

I'm going to have a **** 

02:52:27.804 --> 02:52:30.373
stroke. 

02:52:38.615 --> 02:52:41.918
I wait a minute and 

02:52:42.085 --> 02:52:45.255
Regroup on my mark. 

02:52:46.757 --> 02:52:49.125
Dude, I don't think I've ever 

02:52:47.824 --> 02:52:49.826
seen a looting in like a battle 

02:52:49.192 --> 02:52:51.227
royale game be as bad as this 

02:52:49.926 --> 02:52:53.430
**** video game. I'm not 

02:52:51.294 --> 02:52:54.564
going to lie. Though they don't 

02:52:53.496 --> 02:52:55.732
look at any other game and 

02:52:54.631 --> 02:52:58.802
realize, oh wait, if we do it 

02:52:55.799 --> 02:53:00.303
like this, like **** grabbing 

02:52:58.868 --> 02:53:01.705
people's loot after you kill em 

02:53:00.369 --> 02:53:03.039
is actually like the **** most 

02:53:01.772 --> 02:53:04.941
worst, like the worst thing 

02:53:03.106 --> 02:53:06.676
I've ever seen in my life. It's 

02:53:05.008 --> 02:53:09.145
like, why did they leave half 

02:53:06.743 --> 02:53:11.081
the **** out and have the **** 

02:53:09.212 --> 02:53:13.016
That was kind of like blackout, 

02:53:11.147 --> 02:53:15.318
right? Sort of like blackout. 

02:53:13.083 --> 02:53:18.388
Everything was in like **** 

02:53:15.385 --> 02:53:21.691
bang, bro. Yeah. It's just 

02:53:18.455 --> 02:53:24.961
literally just words. The UI is 

02:53:21.758 --> 02:53:28.698
confusing. **** like some guy 

02:53:25.028 --> 02:53:29.999
off of Netflix made it. It's 

02:53:28.765 --> 02:53:30.934
like you're trying too hard at 

02:53:30.066 --> 02:53:31.601
some point. He's going to 

02:53:31.001 --> 02:53:34.370
realize that you're trying too 

02:53:31.668 --> 02:53:37.741
hard. Our UAV is orbiting the 

02:53:34.437 --> 02:53:40.977
area. No pal. Wait, did they 

02:53:37.807 --> 02:53:40.977
grab the scene? 

02:53:49.186 --> 02:53:52.422
holding high-value equipment 

02:53:51.054 --> 02:53:54.591
have been located. Secure I 

02:53:52.488 --> 02:53:57.660
need them bands. I need them 

02:53:54.658 --> 02:53:57.660
bands. 

02:53:57.827 --> 02:54:00.196
And then I don't even know how 

02:53:58.996 --> 02:54:02.699
to **** navigate half these 

02:54:00.263 --> 02:54:03.900
buildings. Yeah, I know. 

02:54:02.766 --> 02:54:04.935
Especially this little **** 

02:54:03.966 --> 02:54:07.571
blue buildings that we're in, 

02:54:05.002 --> 02:54:08.305

02:54:07.638 --> 02:54:09.839
yeah. There's an upstairs. We 

02:54:08.371 --> 02:54:11.708
gotta go out. I get time. They 

02:54:09.906 --> 02:54:14.477
gotta go back outside. One 

02:54:11.774 --> 02:54:16.413
thing down. Two to go. Two. I 

02:54:14.544 --> 02:54:17.880

02:54:16.480 --> 02:54:21.050
like this map better than, 

02:54:17.947 --> 02:54:21.050
yeah, the master. 

02:54:27.424 --> 02:54:32.095
Give me your white chest, **** 

02:54:36.199 --> 02:54:40.037
I think isn't literally like 

02:54:37.467 --> 02:54:42.606
every other **** like bounty in 

02:54:40.103 --> 02:54:45.208
the same kind of like **** **** 

02:54:42.673 --> 02:54:49.312
You've secured all the Contact 

02:54:45.275 --> 02:54:53.316
complete. Crackers. How much 

02:54:49.378 --> 02:54:58.521

think marked the strongholds on 

02:54:59.890 --> 02:55:02.759
the map. Oh, this one's 

02:55:01.625 --> 02:55:07.463
unmarked. It just has on my 

02:55:02.826 --> 02:55:07.463

We may stop right here, boys. 

02:55:35.992 --> 02:55:39.195
Hi, yourself again.

02:55:49.406 --> 02:55:54.578
Oh. Oh. Oh, right. SMG. I got a

02:55:54.644 --> 02:56:01.918

02:55:57.947 --> 02:56:06.022

02:56:06.623 --> 02:56:10.493
Moving here.

02:57:15.559 --> 02:57:18.728

Dropping ammo here.

02:57:46.056 --> 02:57:48.124
occupied right now. They won't 

02:57:46.723 --> 02:57:50.093
realize how we're gone. How's 

02:57:48.191 --> 02:57:51.761

02:57:50.160 --> 02:57:54.864

03:20:42.664 --> 03:20:46.201
don't know. Bro, you can't even 

03:20:45.033 --> 03:20:49.337
overflow. Like you're so 

03:20:46.268 --> 03:20:49.337
stupid. 

03:20:51.907 --> 03:20:56.278
Come here. I mean, that process 

03:20:54.710 --> 03:20:57.645
is really good but it is a ball 

03:20:56.344 --> 03:20:59.280
in the neck. If you have a 

03:20:57.712 --> 03:21:01.816
forty-ninety, that process is 

03:20:59.347 --> 03:21:05.253
not good enough. Handle of 

03:21:01.883 --> 03:21:07.121
4090. But we'll see. See what 

03:21:05.319 --> 03:21:09.591
happens. Oh, I know. I have 

03:21:07.188 --> 03:21:10.525
that process. Not, not that 

03:21:09.658 --> 03:21:11.259
one. I have the K version 

03:21:10.592 --> 03:21:15.863
because you know, I'm I'm not 

03:21:11.326 --> 03:21:15.863
cheap and I bought that. 

03:21:22.704 --> 03:21:28.276
Mine was seven. The enemy down. 

03:21:26.708 --> 03:21:31.512
No, I sent you fifty bucks. 

03:21:28.343 --> 03:21:31.512
It's like nothing. 

03:21:47.029 --> 03:21:51.466
which probably would definitely 

03:22:24.599 --> 03:22:27.902
you have so much money. 

03:22:29.071 --> 03:22:35.176
But look what gives so much 

03:22:32.174 --> 03:22:35.176
money. 

03:22:40.716 --> 03:22:44.852
Watch out. Wait till I'm 

03:22:41.817 --> 03:22:44.852
finished, bro. 

03:22:53.729 --> 03:22:57.365
Nobody doesn't make a moves. 

03:23:12.514 --> 03:23:17.118
There you go. Done. 

03:23:37.005 --> 03:23:43.344
here. Bams. Bams. Look at them 

03:23:40.542 --> 03:23:44.479
vans. Where's that? Robots in 

03:23:43.411 --> 03:23:47.515
there? You should have enough 

03:23:44.545 --> 03:23:47.515
there. 

03:23:49.451 --> 03:23:52.087
Dude, my god, my game is 

03:23:51.018 --> 03:23:53.088
going to glitch again. I'm just 

03:23:52.153 --> 03:23:56.224
going to buy him ammunition box 

03:23:53.154 --> 03:23:58.393
and. Bang, I buy a Fenneck. 

03:23:56.291 --> 03:23:59.760
Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. 

03:23:58.460 --> 03:24:00.428
Okay, the money isn't showing 

03:23:59.827 --> 03:24:01.796
up for me. The money's not 

03:24:00.495 --> 03:24:05.800
showing up, Switch. I'm not 

03:24:01.863 --> 03:24:05.800
going to let me do it. 

03:24:07.736 --> 03:24:12.507
the **** money is hollowed out. 

03:24:09.171 --> 03:24:12.507
It's not letting me drop it. 

03:24:13.141 --> 03:24:21.582
Okay. But they're doing a 

03:24:16.111 --> 03:24:21.582
rebound by the UAV. Yeah, sure. 

03:24:22.083 --> 03:24:27.722
Targets are marked under attack 

03:24:23.184 --> 03:24:27.722
map. Guys behind us. 

03:24:29.558 --> 03:24:33.861
Pop it. 

03:24:55.851 --> 03:25:04.759
Pullover. This is the police. 

03:25:00.021 --> 03:25:04.759
You were under arrest. 

03:25:08.530 --> 03:25:11.799
What is that guy doing 

03:25:13.768 --> 03:25:19.640
Who's ready to blow up? Let me 

03:25:16.671 --> 03:25:19.640
know. 

03:25:20.075 --> 03:25:25.613
Enemy UAV overhead. No, this is 

03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:27.281
the police. All over. Game is 

03:25:25.680 --> 03:25:30.318
really **** intriguing 

03:25:27.348 --> 03:25:30.318
sometimes. 

03:25:36.157 --> 03:25:42.764
Jenny could cross over the 

03:25:37.892 --> 03:25:45.666

03:25:42.831 --> 03:25:47.936

03:25:45.733 --> 03:25:50.972

03:25:48.003 --> 03:25:50.972
