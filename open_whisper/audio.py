# break audio files into 30-second segments paired with subset of transcript that occurs within that time segment
# audio is resampled to 16000 hz, 80-channel log-magnitude mel spectrogram, computed with a 25ms window and 10ms hop size
# spectrogram is a visual representation of spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time
# mel spectrogram is a spectrogram that is generated using the Mel scale, a perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from one another
# 80-channel mel spectrogram is a mel spectrogram represented by 80 mel bins (frequency channels)
# feature normalization: globally scale input to be between [-1, 1] with approximate mean 0 across pre-training dataset
