It’s a little more comfortable.\\n\\n13\\n00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:25,100\\nSet air-fryer with 180 degree and cook pork belly for 15 mins.\\n\\n14\\n00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:37,220\\nNow cook bean sprout. Make sure add salt to the water.\\n\\n15\\n00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:54,040\\nAnd make sure wait for the water to boil!! Bean sprout makes sure cook with boiling water. And add bean sprout.\\n\\n16\\n00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:10,140\\nCook until the bean sprout is slightly change to light color.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:21,780\\nIf the bean sprouts are cooked, rinse them in cold water.\\n\\n18\\n00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,420\\nMake sure to drain the rinsed bean sprouts.\\n\\n19\\n00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:38,620\\nCut the bean sprouts into a good size to mix with the dumpling fillings.\\n\\n20\\n00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,280\\nThen, please add it to the filling mix.\\n\\n21\\n00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,740\\nOk! pork oil is ready!!\\n\\n22\\n00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,520\\nNow add all the seasoning and mix all ingredients.\\n\\n23\\n00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,020\\n1. Pork oil\\n\\n24\\n00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:13,080\\n2. add egg, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, kimchi juices\\n\\n25\\n00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:27,200\\n3. black pepper will helps pork flavour.                               4. The sesame oil makes the dumpling flavor even more!! 5. Lastly, add fish sauce for seasoning.\\n\\n26\\n00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:35,100\\nNow you can mix!!

is our pride.\\n\\n7\\n00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:04,503\\nLet's see the answer to the previous question, in this video!\\n\\n8\\n00:01:09,596 --> 00:01:21,524\\nThough we classify Cheras, Cholas, Pandyas, and Pallavas\\nas four different dynasties, together they were called Dravidians.\\n\\n9\\n00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:44,969\\nMonarchies allowed only male succession, usually from father to son.\\nCommon Public or women were not allowed to rule the country.\\n\\n10\\n00:01:45,158 --> 00:01:53,411\\nWe have no clue about how it would have been\\nif they had followed democracy instead of monarchy.\\n\\n11\\n00:01:53,610 --> 00:02:00,410\\nOne particular type of evolution was constant throughout\\nthe world at that time.\\n\\n12\\n00:02:00,595 --> 00:02:07,737\\nAnd as monarchy has been widely followed by different parts\\nof the world for ages,\\n\\n13\\n00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:11,247\\nwe too had monarchy system till the advent of the British.\\n\\n14\\n00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:13,784\\nThere are Pros and cons to the monarchy system.\\n\\n15\\n00:02:13,988 --> 00:02:16,779\\nBut our kings have done a lot for the welfare of our country.\\n\\n16\\n00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:26,121\\nThough we always comment about rich powerful people,\\nIn those days kings who had wealth brought about changes.\\n\\n17\\n00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:28,949\\nBut few kings failed to utilize it for good!\\n\\n18\\n00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:37,312\\nOur land was once ruled by many great kings.\\nLet's see how it started and how Ponniyin Selvan happened!\\n\\n19\\n00:02:37,633 --> 00:02:45,288\\nThough Karikala Cholan built The Great Kallanai in the 2nd century,\\nthe Chola Dynasty didn't flourish at that time.\\n\\n20\\n00:02:45,476 --> 00:03:09,914\\nPandyas and\\n Pallavas fought often during\\nthe 6-7th century.\\n\\n21\\n00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:28,455\\nVijayalaya Chola uses this opportunity to defeat Pandyas,\\nconquers Tanjore and announces it as their capital.\\n\\n22\\n00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:37,567\\nHe also conquers Madurai, and the 6-7th centuries are all\\nabout Pandyas and Pallavas only.\\n\\n23\\n00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:43,940\\nKalki's 'Parthiban Kanavu' is all about these wars,\\n\\n24\\n00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:54,803\\nIt talks about the dream of a Chola king Parthiban who wanted\\nto establish the Chola dynasty as the dominant force.\\n\\n25\\n00:03:54,948 --> 00:04:11,750\\nParthiban dies in Warfield and mentions, that his dream\\nwill be made true by a king 300 years from now.\\n\\n26\\n00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,818\\nAnd the story of Ponniyin Selvan begins there.\\n\\n27\\n00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:24,005\\nDuring the 6-7th centuries,\\nthe Chola dynasty, was under Pallava- Pandyas rule.\\n\\n28\\n00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:32,960\\nAnd with burning desire, Vijayalaya Chola fought and defeated the Pandyas\\nto conquer Tanjore.\\n\\n29\\n00:04:33,242 --> 00:04:37,707\\nThen Parantaka Chola, the successor of Vijayalaya Chola\\ndefeats Pallavas.\\n\\n30\\n00:04:37,858 --> 00:04:44,504\\nThe advent of the Chola dynasty begins with this victory\\nSundara Cholan is the grand son of Parantaka Cholan.\\n\\n31\\n00:04:44,825 --> 00:04:50,862\\nAnd Ponniyin Selvan is the son of Sundara Cholan.\\nAnd this is where the story of Ponniyin Selvan begins.\\n\\n32\\n00:04:51,180 --> 00:05:01,200\\nThough many Chola kings ruled us, only Raja Raja Cholan,\\nand Rajendra Cholan were celebrated kings.\\n\\n33\\n00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,375\\nRaja raja Cholan conquers, expands the kingdom to Sri Lanka,\\n\\n34\\n00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,436\\nand Rajendra Cholan conquers and expands their kingdom\\nto Malaysia and Sumatra.\\n\\n35\\n00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:25,685\\nThe Father-Son duo plays a great role\\nin the expansion of the Chola dynasty.\\n\\n36\\n00:05:25,835 --> 00:05:28,313\\nYou can learn about Raja Raja Cholan's water management,\\n\\n37\\n00:05:28,463 --> 00:05:42,656\\nElectoral system and architecture in the book 'Raja raja Cholan'\\nby Mannar Mannan and in Balakumaran's 'Udaiyar'.\\n\\n38\\n00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:51,033\\nThese books give us explanations of\\nwhy Cholas are best among other kings.\\n\\n39\\n00:05:51,354 --> 00:05:55,275\\nRaja raja Cholan was a marketing king.\\n\\n40\\n00:05:55,453 --> 00:06:06,454\\na pioneer in architectural technics. Even now we admire\\nTanjore Brihadishvara temple, for it's artistic and\\narchitectural excellence.\\n\\n41\\n00:06:06,774 --> 00:06:24,460\\nMannar mannan mentions Raja Raja Cholan as a visionary,\\nfor building a temple which would stand tall even after 1000 years.\\n\\n42\\n00:06:24,778 --> 00:06:27,733\\nAncient kings followed a practice of 'Meikeerthi'\\nTamil inscriptions of grants issued by kings of South India.\\n\\n43\\n00:06:27,893 --> 00:06:43,662\\nAnd Raja raja Cholan wrote about his welfare activities\\nin his 'Meikeerthi', so that the future generations\\nwill learn about his deeds.\\n\\n44\\n00:06:43,958 --> 00:07:14,533\\nBut Rajendra Cholan's son aimed to establish his father's fame,\\nused coins in which the face of Raja raja cholan is engraved.\\n\\n45\\n00:07:15,377 --> 00:07:33,460\\nThe successors of Raja Raja Cholan further spread\\nhis fame, his knowledge in science, architecture, etc.\\n\\n46\\n00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:46,947\\nHe mentions the names of contributors to the construction\\nof the Tanjore temple in the inscription but not the techniques used!\\n\\n47\\n00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,993\\nbecause that was his secret formula.\\n\\n48\\n00:07:51,148 --> 00:08:21,286\\nBut information like place of acquisition, the type of rocks,\\nand sand used and techniques used to determine the weight of rock\\nfor handy usage is mentioned.\\n\\n49\\n00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:39,486\\nAs Cholas lost a few cities in flood,\\nTanjore was the safest spot so, they built the Big Temple in Tanjore.\\n\\n50\\n00:08:39,808 --> 00:08:58,514\\nPonniyin Selvan talks about all four dynasties.\\nFor eg, Sundaracholan's grandmother is a Chera princess.\\n\\n51\\n00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:11,427\\nAnd here comes the Chinna and Periya Pazhuvettaraiyar.\\nPeriya Pazhuvettairaiyar belonged to the Chera dynasty\\n\\n52\\n00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:24,434\\nVeerapandiyan chops off Uthamaseeli's head\\nand gains a title,\\n\\n53\\n00:09:24,738 --> 00:09:27,844\\n'Uthamaseeli Thalaikonda Kopperungesari Veerapandiyan'!\\n\\n54\\n00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:44,467\\nAnd that is when Cholas decide to seek revenge,\\nand Sundara cholan defeats Pandyas\\nwithout cutting Veerapandiyan's head.\\n\\n55\\n00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:54,084\\nHe implants the seeds of hatred in Adhitha Karikalan\\nfrom a very young age, to avenge the death of Uthamaseeli,\\n\\n56\\n00:09:54,415 --> 00:10:03,336\\nand he chops off Veerapandiyan's head!\\n\\n57\\n00:10:03,499 --> 00:10:08,722\\nAnd he was named as,\\n'Veerapandiyan Thalai Konda Kopparakesari Adhitha Karikalan'.\\n\\n58\\n00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:21,904\\nPandyas plots to kill Aditha Karikalan for assasination of Veerapandian.\\nAnd they aimed to bring down the Chola dynasty.\\n\\n59\\n00:10:22,228 --> 00:10:26,764\\nKalki has created fictional characters for the assassination\\nof Aaditha Karikalan, we have found the inscriptional evidence against,\\n\\n60\\n00:10:27,098 --> 00:10:38,643\\nVeerapandyan, Ravidasan, Soman Sambavan.\\nlinking them to Aaditha Karikalan's death,\\n\\n61\\n00:10:38,786 --> 00:10:42,430\\nThe fight between the Pandyas and the Cholas \\n\\n62\\n00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:48,653\\nThe mystery around Aaditha Karikalan's death.\\n\\n63\\n00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:53,905\\nRaja Raja cholan doesn't come to power after\\nthe death of Aaditha Karikalan\\n\\n64\\n00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:58,837\\nUthama Cholan aka Madurandangan the king\\nof the Cholas.\\n\\n65\\n00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:02,771\\nNo one knows where Raja Raja Cholan disappeared\\nduring those 14 years.\\n\\n66\\n00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:06,645\\nThese mysteries are there as a story and in real.\\n\\n67\\n00:11:07,088 --> 00:11:34,173\\nThe fact that we are still praising Raja Raja Cholan is a\\nresult of his vision and his actions which made the vision\\na reality.\\n\\n68\\n00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:50,194\\nHe built statues of himself and had drawings of him.\\nA statue of his is still there in Pondicherry.\\n\\n69\\n00:11:50,571 --> 00:11:54,240\\nThe statue has been recreated in Tanjore as well.\\n\\n70\\n00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:01,351\\nHe took efforts to spread his fame to people\\nand we are seeing the results of those efforts now.\\n\\n71\\n00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:19,123\\nThough we are not sure that his intent back then, his fame has\\nnow spread to Las Vegas through the film and it's trailer.\\n\\n72\\n00:12:19,433 --> 00:12:33,913\\nWe were not alive back then but the actors in PS-1 will\\nbe the faces of those famous characters from now onwwards.\\n\\n73\\n00:12:34,201 --> 00:12:41,904\\nThis book has readers across the world and there are\\nothers who are familiar with the history.\\n\\n74\\n00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:46,526\\nA person attempts to write a book on the Cholas\\nwhich leads to research.\\n\\n75\\n00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:50,002\\nSo many people have attempted to make a film\\nbased on Ponniyin Selvan before\\n\\n76\\n00:12:50,268 --> 00:12:55,382\\nwhich has been made possible by Mani Ratnam\\nwith a huge star cast.\\n\\n77\\n00:12:55,843 --> 00:13:16,617\\nThe fact that the actors playing the roles are the ones\\nwe grew up with is wonderful.\\n\\n78\\n00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:22,916\\nThe vision to make a film on Ponniyin Selvan started with MGR\\nBut it was destined to happen now.\\n\\n79\\n00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:29,679\\nThe film Ponniyin Selvan must be close to the heart\\nfor everyone involved.\\n\\n80\\n00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:49,406\\nIt is being said that all of us are linked to\\none old lady's DNA.\\n\\n81\\n00:13:49,718 --> 00:14:07,982\\nPeople from the same gene have fought, betrayed\\nand schemed against each other.\\n\\n82\\n00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:24,376\\nThe reign of the Cholas coincided with events across the globe\\nbut the Chola reign is still a wonder.\\n\\n83\\n00:14:24,592 --> 00:14:38,497\\nBesides watching the film, you can all take efforts\\nto know about the achievements of Cholas.\\n\\n\", 'duration': 872.769, 'audio_file': '/weka/huongn/ow_full/00000000/48_u42JFNYs/48_u42JFNYs.m4a', 'mach_content': 'WEBVTT\\nKind: captions\\nLanguage:
